Challenge Name: Cert Conundrum
Author: Seb C.

Description: I was attending the IEEE Latin America Conference hoping to get better at cloud computing and AWS. A peer named Narcissus reccomended I get some certifications and even gave me an AMI and practice exams to practice on that he created. I'm not very good at this thing though and I feel like the program isn't working. Mind lending a helping hand?

Hint: Narcissus is a pretty self obsessed guy especially when he names his AMIs.
