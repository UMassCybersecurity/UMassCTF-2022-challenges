   For use cases such as sharing buffer in comint mode, it would be

** TODO Status icons of users should be clickable	    :branch_activity:
   + Components :: user interface

   + Reporter :: jan

   The status icon of users should be clickable. For example, when the
   user is typing, clicking the status icon should move point to the
   location of the changes.
** TODO Keep a log of the current session
   + Components :: multiple components affected

** TODO Always queue outgoing data
   + Components :: transport and protocol backends
   + Type :: task
   + Reporter :: jan
   + Assigned ::
   Large amounts of outgoing data freeze emacs (well, there is a
   progress reporter). Queue this data and using a timer for the
   sending would solve this problem
** TODO Add a queue monitor minor mode
   + Components :: user interface
   + Type :: task
   + Reporter :: jan
   + Assigned ::
   Queuing data before sending it has the disadvantage of allowing the
   queue to grow arbitrarily large if more outgoing data is generated
   than the link can handle. Therefore, there should be some
   indication of the amount of queued data.

   For small successive edits, the overhead is large in most

   Steps to reproduce the problem
   1. Start Emacs process (A)
   2. Host session in A
   3. Join session in A
   4. Start Emacs process (B)
   5. Join session in B specifying a color that clashes with A's color
      choice
   6. To complete joining the session, choosing a different color is
      required
   In the resulting state A's (and maybe also the server's?)

   `global-mode-line-publish-state-mode` is define using

   changes. The minor mode is not activated for buffers create by
   `create-buffer`. Since this is used when subscribing to documents,
   this is a problem.
