### Description

I'm trying to write the program to print out the flag,
with only one bug left. However, before I could fix it,
my future me stole it and obfuscated it
~~, preventing the route to dystopia~~.
Can you help me get back the source code?
And promise you won't look at the flag?

### Flag

`UMASS{C0NGR4T5!__C++_15_FUN_1SN'T_1T?}`
