## What's left to do
1. Make actual website look nice
2. Dockerize challenge
3. Stability testing, throw a bunch of traffic at the registration to make sure this challenge will not crash or eat up server resources
4. Specfically write down how this challenge is meant to be attempted (for example if source code should be given)
