Challenge Name: Cert Conundrum
Author: Seb C.

Description: I was attending the IEEE Latin America Conference hoping to get better at cloud computing and AWS. A peer named Julio Jonesy reccomended I get some certifications and even gave me an AMI and practice exams to practice on that he created. I'm not very good at this thing though and I feel like the program isn't working. Mind lending a helping hand?

Hint: I wish one cloud could cover the entire world...

Dev Notes: I got most of the quiz up just need to transfer from laptop to here. Then I'll get an AMI up where users get user privs and they will just run the compiled .exe of the python to go through the test.
