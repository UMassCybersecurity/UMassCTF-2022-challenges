    <p>My AP computer science class is boring as hell. I taught myself how to
program a year ago, so I came into the class already knowing most of the
curriculum. The in-class assignments only take me five or ten minutes, leaving
me with the better part of an hour to hack on whatever I want. This is the pet
project that occupies me for those 50 minutes. Some dumb roguelike game. It was
fun to make. Hopefully it's fun to play, too.</p>
