# easterisland

You can't get everywhere by foot, and you'd be mad to swim across an ocean. Can
you think of another way to get to an island?

# Notes

Pretty simple browser game. The client is a static page that communicates with
the server via websocket. It uses SQLite, so there isn't much in the way of
infrastructure requirements.
